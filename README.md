3.) Paste the cura folder over the top of the cura folder that is already there.

4.) Open Cura and add your MagnetoX 

5.) üõë ‚ÑπÔ∏è Check the start GCODE and verify it will work for your setup

## Known Issues
+ ASA profiles seem to be broken. I'm not sure why yet.
+ The printer name is always MagnetoX #2 for me. Not sure why that is either.
+ Cura log shows ``NameError: name 'skirt' is not defined`` due to the values for ``adhesion_type`` (Code [in MagnetoX.def.json]([url](https://github.com/magnetoxgarage/Cura-Profiles/blob/d16a877ba92a25e53f93f191fc5c56f3ea2a9b6c/cura/5.9/definitions/MagnetoX.def.json#L34-L38)))
