⚠️ These profiles are not finalized. They may not have proper constraints and the toolhead dimensions may not be correct for single object printing. Use at your own risk.

## How to Use
1.) Download/clone the project
2.) On Windows, browse to: %APPDATA% (You can type into File Explorer or the Windows Run command)
3.) Paste the cura folder over the top of the cura folder that is already there.
4.) Open Cura and add your MagnetoX 

## Known Issues
ASA profiles seem to be broken. I'm not sure why yet.
The printer name is always MagnetoX #2 for me. Not sure why that is either.
