![alt text](image.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è üöß THESE PROFILES ARE A WORK-IN-PROGRESS üöß

‚ö†Ô∏è Printer may not have proper constraints

‚ö†Ô∏è The Toolhead dimensions may not be correct for 'Print One at a time' (Print-by-object) printing. Use at your own risk.

## How to Use
1.) Download/clone the project

2.) On Windows, browse to: %APPDATA% (You can type into File Explorer or the Windows Run command).

On Linux distros you will likely be able to use `~/.local/share/cura`

3.) Paste the cura folder over the top of the cura folder that is already there.

4.) Open Cura and add your Magneto X 

5.) üõë ‚ÑπÔ∏è Check the start GCODE and verify it will work for your setup

## Known Issues
+ Many filament settings have not been copied over
+ If using KAMP, start GCODE will need to be changed to EXTRUDER_TEMP and BED_TEMP
+ ASA profiles seem to be broken. I'm not sure why. The same seems to occur with Voron ASA profiles.

Pull requests are welcome!
